# VAERS: COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Reaction Analysis
This is an analysis I did for my Informatics class. The dataset comes from the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) created by the CDC and FDA. It contains patient level data on adverse reactions from the COVID-19 vaccine. Headed into the project, I wanted to see if I could classify whether or not an individual may or may not experience severe side-effects based on factors such as age, gender, vaccine manufacturer, and medical history using machine learning algorithms. Secondly, I wanted to see if there was a relationship between number of days it took to show symptoms from vaccination and the number of total symptoms someone was experiencing. This was accomplished using linear regression and correlation tests. During the analysis, I noticed a trend where older individuals seemed to be more likely to have severe side-effects which led to the third research question. In that, is there a significant difference in age between those patients who experienced severe side-effects and those who did not? Check out the Jupyter notebook for the results!
